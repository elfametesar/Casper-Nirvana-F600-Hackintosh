# Casper-Nirvana-F600-Hackintosh

Normally, this laptop has an external GPU which is 940MX however mine was removed, so I haven't checked if the EFIs disable external graphics. If you have an eGPU, make sure to disable it first.

These EFIs have been tested on Ventura and Monterey, any version below these you'll have to test it yourself.

Specs:
 - i7-7500u Kaby-Lake
 - Intel HD620 Graphics
 - Realtek ALC 269 Audio
 - RTL8723BE Wireless card (Not supported, I am using Intel 3160 AC)

What's working:
 - Graphics
 - Mic and speakers
 - There is no wireless kext installed. I am using 3160 AC so that's working
 - Ethernet
 - USB Tethering
 - Etc..

What's broken:
 - You tell me
